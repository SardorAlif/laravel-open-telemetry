Measuring performance and tracking bugs is typically done inside a single web request or job. But what if you want to see the performance or flow of a web request together with all the jobs it dispatched?

Open Telemetry, or OTel for short, is a collection of tools, APIs and SDKs to collect information on how an entire system is behaving. A "system" can be a single application, or a group of applications (or queued jobs) that are working together.

Using the laravel-open-telemetry package you can easily measure performance of a Laravel powered system. It can transmit the results to a tracing tool like [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io) or [Aspecto](https://www.aspecto.io).

In your Laravel application, you can use start and stop measurements using the `Measure` facade. You can nest measurements how deep you like.

```php
use Spatie\OpenTelemetry\Facades\Measure;

Measure::start('parent');
sleep(1);
Measure::start('child');

sleep(2);

Measure::stop('child');
sleep(3);
Measure::stop('parent');
```

Here's how that will look like in Jaeger:

The real value of this package comes when also using it to measure an entire process the includes the web requests, one or more jobs / services.

```php
Measure::start('my-web-request');

Measure::stop('my-web-request');

dispatch(new MyJob()); // let's imagine that this jobs has a `sleep(1)` in its `handle` method.
```

The package will automatically measure any jobs. Any measurements in the job will be associated with the web request that dispatch it.

This is how it would look like in Jaeger:

Jaeger and similar tools can calculate averages and display very interesting statistics around the measurements made. This will greatly help you understand how your application as a whole is performing.

This package isn't a full implementation of everything Open Telemetry has to offer. Its goal is to provide the easiest way to work with traces and span in a Laravel app.
